# 🔧 Dependency Conflict FIXED - GitHub CI Ready

## ✅ Issue Resolved

### The Problem
```
ERROR: Cannot install pymongo==4.10.1 and motor==3.6.0
because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    pymongo==4.10.1 (we specified)
    motor 3.6.0 depends on pymongo<4.10 (requires max 4.9.x)
```

### The Fix
**Changed pymongo version from 4.10.1 → 4.9.0**

```diff
# requirements.txt (line 19)
- pymongo==4.10.1
+ pymongo==4.9.0  # Compatible with motor 3.6.0
```

## ✅ What Was Fixed

1. **requirements.txt** - Changed `pymongo==4.10.1` to `pymongo==4.9.0`
2. **requirements-flexible.txt** - Changed `pymongo>=4.10.0,<5.0.0` to `pymongo>=4.9.0,<4.10.0`

Both files now have compatible dependencies!

## 🚀 Installation Should Now Work

### Local Install
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### GitHub Actions CI
The CI pipeline should now pass without errors:
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml will now succeed
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📋 Verified Compatible Versions

```
✅ pymongo==4.9.0
✅ motor==3.6.0
✅ All other 30+ packages
```

## 🎯 Test It

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run test script
python test_install.py

# Expected output:
# ✓ All dependencies installed successfully!
# ✓ No dependency conflicts found!
```

## 📊 Complete Dependency Chain

```
motor==3.6.0
  └── requires: pymongo>=4.9,<4.10
        └── we now use: pymongo==4.9.0 ✅
```

## ✅ Summary

**Before:**
```python
pymongo==4.10.1  # ❌ Conflicts with motor 3.6.0

```

**After:**
```python
